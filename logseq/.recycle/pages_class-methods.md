- Properties in objects are separated using commas. This is not the case when using the class syntax. Methods in classes do not have any separators between them.
- ```JavaScript
  class Song {
    play() {
    	console.log('Playing!');
    }
    stop() {
    	console.log('Stopping!');
    }
  }
  ```

- JavaScript classes support the concept of inheritance â€” a child class can extend a parent class. This is accomplished by using the extends keyword as part of the class definition.
	- Child classes have access to all of the instance properties and methods of the parent class. They can add their own properties and methods in addition to those.
	- A child class constructor calls the parent class constructor using the `super()` method.
	- ```JavaScript
	  // Parent class
	  class Media {
	    constructor(info) {
	    this.publishDate = info.publishDate;
	    this.name = info.name;
	    }
	  }
	  
	  // Child class
	  class Song extends Media {
	    constructor(songData) {
	    super(songData);
	    this.artist = songData.artist;
	    }
	  }
	  
	  const mySong = new Song({
	    artist: 'Queen',
	    name: 'Bohemian Rhapsody',
	    publishDate: 1975
	  });
	  ```

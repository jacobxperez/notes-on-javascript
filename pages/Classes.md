- [[Class]] JavaScript supports the concept of classes as a syntax for creating objects.
- [[Class Constructor]] This is a special method that is called when the object is created (instantiated).
- [[Class Methods]] Properties in objects are separated using commas. This is not the case when using the class syntax. Methods in classes do not have any separators between them.
- [[Static Methods]] Static methods are not called on individual instances of the class, but are called on the class itself.
- [[Extends]] JavaScript classes support the concept of inheritance, a child class can extend a parent class.

- Within a JavaScript class, the static keyword defines a static method for a class. Static methods are not called on individual instances of the class, but are called on the class itself. Therefore, they tend to be general (utility) methods.

	- ```JavaScript
	  class Dog {
	    constructor(name) {
	      this._name = name;
	    }
	    introduce() {
	      console.log('This is ' + this._name
	      + ' !');
	    }
	    // A static method
	    static bark() {
	    	console.log('Woof!');
	    }
	  }
	  
	  const myDog = new Dog('Buster');
	  myDog.introduce();
	  
	  // Calling the static method
	  Dog.bark();
	  ```

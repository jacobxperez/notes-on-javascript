- [[Object]]: JavaScript is designed on a simple object-based paradigm. An object is a built-in data type for storing key-value pairs. Data inside objects are unordered, and the values can be of any type.

- [[Object Properties]]: Properties of a JavaScript object can be accessed using the dot notation in this manner: `object.propertyName`
- [[Naming Properties]]: JavaScript object key names must adhere to some
  restrictions to be valid.
- [[Objects as Arguments]]: When JavaScript objects are passed as arguments to functions or methods, they are passed by reference, not by value.
